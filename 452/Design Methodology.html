        <h1>Design Methodology</h1>  
        <p>Website positioning and planning: This is the first step in designing a website, and it requires clarity about the website's goals, audience, and features. This involves deciding on the theme, style, content, and layout of the website, among other things.
            Needs analysis and planning: This step requires an in-depth analysis of the target audience to understand their needs and preferences in order to design a website that is more in line with the needs of the users. At the same time, a website design and development plan needs to be developed, including timelines, budgets, and resources, etc.
            Design and production: According to the results of demand analysis and planning, start the design and production of the website. This includes the layout of the web page, the choice of colors, fonts and images, etc. At the same time, it is also necessary to consider the interactivity and user experience of the website, so that users can easily and quickly access and obtain information.
            Development and programming: According to the design draft, use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other front-end technologies for page development and programming. This step needs to take into account factors such as browser compatibility, responsive design, etc., to ensure that the website can display and function properly on different devices and browsers.
            Testing and debugging: Once the development is complete, the website needs to be thoroughly tested and debugged. This includes the layout of the page, browser compatibility, functional testing, and more. At the same time, it is also necessary to detect and optimize the loading speed and security of the website.
            Publishing and maintenance: After testing and debugging, the website can be published to the server for users to access. At the same time, it is also necessary to carry out regular maintenance and update of the website to ensure the stability and security of the website.</p>
